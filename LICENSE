IN MEMORIAM

Written and preserved as a testament to the year 1404 (2025–2026),
a year marked by fear, hardship, uncertainty, and deep concern
for the future of our country and the fate of our youth.

Despite exhaustion, anxiety, and disappointment,
we chose not to abandon our path.
We continued to work, to build, and to move forward together,
believing that perseverance itself was an act of resistance.

Dedicated to my colleagues,
whose companionship during these times
was the sole reason I found the strength to continue:

Ermia Elahi  
Ali Reshad Feizi  
Arian Razzaghi  
Arian Seif  

Dated: 15 Dey 1404  
Written in anticipation of another war,
and in hope for the collapse of a corrupt republic.
